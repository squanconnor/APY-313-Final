# APY-313-Final
Course taken with Dr. Steven Moran, Anthropology Associate Professor.  This was a data science course with a data practical as a final project.  I chose the topic of Simple Moving Average versus Exponential Moving Average as tactics for predicting the stock market.

The stocks file is a zipped folder of all the stock market csv's I used for the project.  WalshConnor.Rmd is the raw rmd file for the project, and then Summary is the knitted html file.
